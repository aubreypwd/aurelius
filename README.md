# Aurelius

This is a block that renders a random quote by Marcus Aurelius in the Editor and on the Frontend when it is placed on a page or post.

- It does not save the quote, they are always random
- You can add new blocks to the Editor and it will find a quote for you
- Uses https://stoic-wisdom.com/api by https://davidmcgregor.dev/
